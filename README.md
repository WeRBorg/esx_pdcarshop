# esx_pdcarshop 

Greetings all, this is my first release hope it helps

I created this copying the esx_boatshop, so all credits goes to HumanTree92. With the new esx_eden garage2: 3 in 1 garage and the new esx_policejob Officers can still buy Police cars but cant store in garage anymore cause they dont save in DB unless you put em in the esx_vehicleshop, so i had an idea and thought why not make this for PD. Iâ€™m still learning code and have no clue how to make this Job only and have certain cars for each rank, any help on this would be greatly appreciated. So far it works very well and makes it so any police vehicle bought is owned by the officer and will go to car garage. would also like to combine the other vehicles such as police boats and choppers.
